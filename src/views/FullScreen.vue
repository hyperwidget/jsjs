      <h1>FullScreen Browser API</h1>
      <p>
        Have you ever wanted or needed to make either some or part of a page/app
        fill the user's screen? Think of the fullscreen experience of a
        videoplayer, or an app that needs more real-estate on the user's screen
        - how might you support that?
      </p>
      <p>
        You <em>could</em> instruct the user to hit some function keys to bring
        their browser into full screen mode - but that's not a great experience!
        It requires considerations for different browsers, operating systems,
        and only makes the whole page full screen üôÖüèº. If only there were a
        better way ü§î!
      </p>

      <h2>Enter the browser API</h2>
      <p>
        As of late 2019, most major browsers support the `FullScreen API`. This
        API makes it possible to present desired content using the user's entire
        screen, removing all browser user interface elements and other
        applications from the screen until full-screen mode is shut off.

          >The fullscreen API</a
        >
        contains several methods, event handlers, properties, etc - however the
        main ones that we'll focus on here
      </p>

      <p>
        Clicking the button below will demo what this looks like (note that it
        doesn't look super super pretty, because the styling doesn't take full
        screen into consideration)
      </p>
      <q-btn @click="toggleFullScreen">Make the whole page full screen</q-btn>
