    <h1>FullScreen Browser API</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever wanted or needed to make either some or part of a page/app
      fill the user's screen? Think of the fullscreen experience of a
      videoplayer, or an app that needs more real-estate on the user's screen -
      how might you support that?
    </p>
    <p>
      You <em>could</em> instruct the user to hit some function keys to bring
      their browser into full screen mode - but that's not a great experience!
      It requires considerations for different browsers, operating systems, and
      only makes the whole page full screen üôÖüèº. If only there were a better way
      ü§î!
    </p>

    <h2>Enter the browser API</h2>
    <p>
      As of late 2019, most major browsers support the `FullScreen API`. This
      API makes it possible to present desired content using the user's entire
      screen, removing all browser user interface elements and other
      applications from the screen until full-screen mode is shut off.
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API"
        >The fullscreen API</a
      >
      contains several methods, event handlers, properties, etc - however the
      main ones that we'll focus on here are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>requestFullscreen</li>
      <li>exitFullscreen</li>
      <li>fullScreenEnabled</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Clicking the button below will demo what this looks like (note that it
      doesn't look super super pretty, because the styling doesn't take full
      screen into consideration)
    </p>
    <q-btn @click="toggleFullScreen">Make the whole page full screen</q-btn>

      <h4>Making a DOM element full screen</h4>

          <p>
            It's actually pretty simple to make DOM elements full screen! There
            are two main steps:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Target the element</li>
            <li>Ask it to go full screen üôè</li>
          </ul>
